## Data-driven dance

## Song ideas

### Bring things in parts at a time
In the music and video, we can bring in things parts at a time.
A cool way of doing this is to use datasets that only start at
a particular time, but we could also do this by arbitrarily cutting
things off. Or we could cut things off at meaningful places.

### Live data feed
Something in the music and video changes based on a Wiimote or
whatever. We can hand that out to the audience
