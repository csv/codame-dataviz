## Data-driven dance

## General inspirations

### Bring things in parts at a time
In the music and video, we can bring in things parts at a time.
A cool way of doing this is to use datasets that only start at
a particular time, but we could also do this by arbitrarily cutting
things off. Or we could cut things off at meaningful places.

### Live data feed
Something in the music and video changes based on a Wiimote or
whatever. We can hand that out to the audience

## Song ideas

### Ambient
Fit a model to some sparse and small dataset. Map the model
predictions to notes.

For example, we predict
[how many public meetings Missouri is holding](http://thomaslevine.com/!/socrata-calendars/)
by week. We have different instruments depending on the lengths of
the meetings.

We interpolate
